# Description

Embark on a journey to the heights using magical instruments while occasionally surfing the beat. This is a fable about jumps and rhythm.

A fair man should take a star from the sky if a maiden asks so (even if she just wanted to get rid of him) ! Our carefree bard will do anything in the name of love (with a little help from you and magic). It's time to strike the space and "borrow" some stars.

Perform instrument actions to take you higher to your goal, collect gems to buy upgrades and new instruments, and fight bosses ! Play on your PC or a phone: be sure to use headphones for a better experience.

Conquer the sky !
